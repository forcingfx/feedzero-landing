/**
 * Source of truth for FeedZero release notes.
 *
 * Edit this file when cutting a new release. Then run:
 *   node build-releases.mjs
 * to regenerate releases.xml (the Atom feed) and releases/index.html.
 *
 * The feed is hosted at https://feedzero.app/releases.xml and the app
 * (my.feedzero.app) subscribes to it. Preserve the entry identifiers
 * (`feedzero:release:<version>`) and the feed `<id>` (`feedzero:changelog`):
 * changing them makes every existing subscriber treat old entries as new.
 *
 * Style: plain, factual, README/man-page tone. See
 * ~/.claude/projects/.../memory/feedback_writing_style.md for the full rules.
 * Short rule of thumb: describe what changed, not how exciting it is. No
 * marketing verbs, no emojis, no call-to-action, no em-dashes. Each bullet
 * is one verb-led past-tense sentence ending with a period.
 */

    title: "Self-host packaged, privacy promise enforced",
    subtitle:
      "Self-host deploys in three commands via Docker. The client stops loading Vercel Speed Insights. Error logs stop emitting feed URLs. The repository ships an explicit AGPL-3.0-or-later LICENSE.",
    added: [
      "Added a single-container Docker deploy with Caddy in front for automatic TLS. <code>cp .env.example .env</code>, edit one value, run <code>./scripts/feedzero up</code>. Day-2 ops (<code>update</code>, <code>backup</code>, <code>restore</code>, <code>logs</code>, <code>doctor</code>) wrap the underlying docker-compose commands so self-hosters do not memorize them.",
      "Added <code>scripts/feedzero</code> (POSIX shell) and <code>scripts/feedzero.ps1</code> (PowerShell) so the same surface works on macOS, Linux, WSL2, Git Bash, and native Windows.",
      "Added a comprehensive self-hosting guide at <code>docs/self-hosting.md</code>. Covers Docker installation on each OS, public-hostname deploys via Let's Encrypt, LAN-only deploys with self-signed certs (with per-OS instructions for trusting Caddy's root CA), day-2 operations, and the seven failures self-hosters actually hit.",
      "Added a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and publishes a multi-arch self-host image (amd64 + arm64) to <code>ghcr.io/forcingfx/feedzero</code> on every version tag. Raspberry Pi self-hosters no longer rebuild from source on updates.",
      "Added integration tests that exercise feed-store and sync-store actions against the real encrypted database via fake-indexeddb. Replaces faith-based mocks at the storage boundary, closing the gap that produced the issue #117 cascade.",
    ],
    changed: [
      "Changed the license from implicit \"All rights reserved\" to <strong>AGPL-3.0-or-later</strong>. The repository now ships a <code>LICENSE</code> file and a matching SPDX identifier in <code>package.json</code>. Section 13 (the network-use clause) means anyone running a modified FeedZero as a public service must offer their users the modified source.",
      "Reduced the first-paint bundle by 90 KB (gzipped). The Defuddle full-text extractor and its adapter registry now load on demand when a user clicks Extracted, not on every page load. Main bundle dropped from 404 KB to 314 KB gzipped — meaningful for the five-year-old phone on a slow connection.",
      "Refactored the feeds route from a 459-line monolith into a layout-with-Outlet shape (ADR 013). The stable two-panel topology survives navigation cleanly and adding a new full-page surface no longer means another <code>isXxxPage</code> flag.",
      "Split the explore catalog from a single 889-line file into a tab-pluggable shell plus per-tab modules. Sets up the upcoming curated catalog work (use-case packs, editorial collections, platform bridges).",
    ],
    fixed: [
      "Server stopped logging full feed URLs in proxy error paths. Previously a failed fetch on <code>/api/feed</code> or <code>/api/icon</code> emitted the target URL into stdout, where it landed in operator-readable log retention. The privacy-floor logger (<code>logError</code>) now handles both call sites with an opaque trace id the user can quote in support.",
    ],
    removed: [
      "Removed the <code>@vercel/speed-insights</code> client SDK. The README's headline privacy promise (“No telemetry. No analytics. No crash reporting. No third-party tracking.”) now matches the shipped code. No page-view or Web-Vitals beacons leave the browser.",

    subtitle: "The sidebar's settings dropdown collapsed into a single button opening a unified five-tab dialog. License holders can now log in to a fresh device via a two-step wizard. OPML import and export preserve folder organization.",
    added: [
      "Added a Log in wizard for license holders on a fresh device. Settings → Account → Already have a FeedZero account opens a two-step ceremony: paste the license token, then optionally enter the sync passphrase to decrypt cloud data. The wizard surfaces alongside the Subscribe call to action so paying users do not accidentally re-purchase.",
      "Added five Settings tabs (Account, Reading, Help, Import, Export) reachable from a single Settings button in the sidebar that replaces the previous dropdown menu. <kbd>Cmd</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd> opens the same dialog.",
      "Added OPML folder preservation. Importing an OPML from Feedly, NetNewsWire, or Inoreader now recreates the parent outline groups as folders and assigns each feed accordingly. Export round-trips the same structure.",
      "Added a Reading tab inside Settings that exposes the article-flood grouping toggle and the Auto-organize launcher.",
      "Added a Help tab inside Settings with inline keyboard shortcuts, a Send feedback button, and a What's new link.",
    ],
    changed: [
      "Consolidated every in-app upgrade button into a single chokepoint. Clicking Upgrade anywhere (sidebar feed-limit notice, Auto-organize gate, feature gates) opens Settings → Account on the Plan card. Stripe Checkout is reachable only from the Plan card's Subscribe buttons, so users always see the tier comparison before committing.",
      "Removed the floating tier pill (Free, Personal, Pro) from the sidebar. It was not clickable and gave a false signal that something there was actionable. The current tier remains visible inside Settings → Account.",
      "Replaced the layered safety controls in Settings → Account with a smaller If-you-lose-access card that shows the support email, an Email-my-license-to-me button, and an Open-recovery-page link. The downloadable plain-text recovery sheet was dropped as redundant with the email-self action.",
      "Widened the desktop sidebar default from 14rem to 18rem so feed titles have room to breathe.",
      "Raised the desktop and mobile breakpoint from 768px to 1024px. The three-panel reading layout is fundamentally a laptop-and-up layout; below 1024px the mobile snap-scroll layout activates cleanly.",
    ],
    fixed: [
      "Fixed the sidebar visibly changing width every time the user navigated between the feeds list, Explore, and Stats. The cause was per-route resizable-panel-group identifiers, which the library persists separately. A single stable identifier across all routes preserves the user-dragged width regardless of navigation.",
      "Fixed the canvas going blank when the browser window was resized between roughly 530 and 767 pixels wide. The desktop layout's panel minimum sizes summed to ~530 pixels but the mobile fallback only kicked in below 768 pixels; the gap left panels clipped by overflow:hidden. Raising the breakpoint to 1024 pixels eliminates the dead zone.",
      "Fixed the sync passphrase reveal overflowing the dialog when the passphrase wrapped long. The container now wraps and scrolls if needed.",
      "Fixed paid users being able to click Delete all data and orphan their Stripe subscription. The Danger Zone now shows Cancel subscription first with a Manage subscription button for paid users; free users see the existing destructive flow.",

    subtitle: "Flooding feeds no longer drown out everything else in aggregated views, a Restore-from-cloud button recovers from drifted local state, and a cross-device sync race that left Device B with the wrong feed list is fixed.",
    added: [
      "Added inline grouping for same-feed article floods in aggregated views (All items and folder views). Runs of three or more consecutive articles from the same feed within ten-minute pairwise gaps collapse to a summary row with a chevron; expanding inline reveals the full list. Disabled in per-feed views and behind a Settings toggle if undesired.",
      "Added a <code>Restore from cloud</code> button to the Data & Storage dialog. Replaces local feeds and articles with the cloud vault without deleting and recreating the vault, which is the recovery path when a device's local state drifts from what the cloud knows.",
    ],
    fixed: [
      "Fixed a cross-device sync race where a second device could mark its status as synced without the cloud feeds materializing locally. Concurrent pulls now share a single in-flight request and the import is transactional, so the article list never serves a half-imported state.",
      "Fixed the prev/next reader navigation pills appearing on desktop, where they duplicated existing keyboard shortcuts and sidebar navigation. The pills remain on mobile, where the touch surface is needed.",
      "Fixed dialog buttons being pushed off-screen on iOS when the soft keyboard opens. Dialogs are now anchored to the dynamic viewport height so the action row stays reachable regardless of keyboard state.",

    fixed: [
      "Fixed cloud sync vault pulls returning the literal string <code>[object Object]</code> instead of the encrypted payload. The server was storing vaults correctly all along; only the read path was broken. Existing vaults are unaffected and now load correctly.",
      "Fixed cloud sync pushes failing with a 500 error after a deployment-time configuration drift. Sync storage now self-detects the correct backend rather than relying on an exact environment-variable match.",
      "Fixed the public stats page always showing zero feeds tracked. The feed catalog had no persistence layer and reset on every cold start; now backed by persistent storage so counts and the popular-feeds leaderboard populate correctly.",
      "Fixed the mobile soft keyboard covering the bottom of every dialog, which made the cloud-sync passphrase entry unusable. The fix applies to every dialog in the app.",
      "Fixed the mobile bottom navigation drawer being partially hidden behind iOS Safari's browser chrome. The drawer's bottom padding now grows dynamically with the toolbar height.",
    ],
    added: [
      "Added per-client rate limiting on the feed and page proxies. Default 300 requests per minute per client; returns <code>429 Retry-After</code> per RFC 6585 when exceeded.",
      "Added a trace identifier (<code>req_</code> followed by 8 hex characters) to every non-2xx response from the monetization endpoints. Quote it in a support report and the issue can be looked up in the runtime logs.",
      "Added structured single-line JSON logs on every 5xx server error, with an allow-listed field set (route, method, status, trace identifier, error class, error message). No personal data is ever logged.",
      "Added module-load logs in each serverless function that surface which storage backend resolved at cold start. Any future regression where the wrong adapter is chosen becomes visible in the first deploy log.",
      "Added production smoke tests for every server endpoint. Run with <code>SMOKE_TESTS=1 npx vitest run tests/smoke/</code>. The smoke layer is now a required phase of the standard development workflow.",
    ],
    changed: [
      "Consolidated all server-side persistence (license records, vault sync, Stripe event deduplication, the feed catalog, and rate-limit counters) onto a single Upstash KV instance. Replaces a previous mix of Vercel Blob, separate Upstash, and in-memory adapters. Self-hosters not configuring Upstash continue to use the filesystem and memory adapters.",

    fixed: [
      "Fixed first-launch initialization continuing to mark onboarding complete when the initial database setup failed (for example on browsers without Web Crypto, such as iOS Lockdown Mode). The error is now surfaced and onboarding is not marked complete, so the user is prompted to retry rather than landing in a half-initialized state.",

      "Added a persistent swipeable bottom drawer on mobile that replaces the offcanvas sidebar. The drawer handle is always visible at the bottom of the screen and shows the current feed name; tapping or swiping up reveals the full feed list, folders, All items, Explore, and Settings.",
      "Added a bottom sheet feed switcher on mobile. The active feed name in the bottom drawer doubles as a switcher: a tap opens a sheet with all feeds and folders.",
      "Added a public stats page at <code>/stats</code>. Shows total vaults, total feeds tracked, and the top 100 feeds by request volume. No accounts, no personal data, no login.",
      "Added automatic color assignment for new folders. Created folders now get a distinct color from the eight-color palette without an extra picker step.",
      "Added the full settings menu inline in the mobile bottom drawer. Cloud sync, Auto-organize, Keyboard shortcuts, Send feedback, and What's new are all reachable without opening a separate dropdown.",

    changed: [
      "Replaced the pull-to-advance gesture on mobile with explicit prev/next nav pills. The pills are pinned to the bottom of the reader and remain accessible regardless of scroll position. Pull-to-advance was removed because behavior was inconsistent across mobile browsers.",
      "The mobile nav pills are now icon-only for back navigation, show no keyboard hints, and stretch to fill the available width. Long article titles in the prev/next labels are truncated with ellipses instead of overflowing.",
      "The desktop sidebar and the mobile bottom drawer now share a single navigation body component. Adding a new top-level entry (such as Explore) only needs to be done in one place.",
    ],
    fixed: [
      "Fixed the article list jumping unexpectedly when clicking an already-visible article. The virtualizer no longer re-anchors on click-driven selection changes; keyboard <kbd>j</kbd>/<kbd>k</kbd> still scroll the selected article into view.",
      "Fixed the mobile bottom drawer overflowing horizontally on viewports with safe-area insets. The drawer now respects the iOS Dynamic Island and notch in all orientations.",
      "Fixed desktop reader navigation pills clipping long article titles. The pills now share the available width and grow to fit instead of letting text overflow.",
      "Fixed the folder title toggle in the sidebar collapsing the folder when clicked. Selecting a feed inside a folder on mobile now snaps back to the article list as expected.",

    added: [
      "Added a three-panel resizable desktop layout. The sidebar, article list, and reader are now independently draggable columns.",
      "Added prev/next navigation pills pinned to the bottom of the reader panel. The pills are always visible regardless of scroll position and show <kbd>k</kbd>/<kbd>j</kbd> keyboard hints.",
      "Added pull-to-advance gesture on mobile. Scrolling past the end of an article advances to the next; pulling down from the top goes back.",
      "Added folder color customization. An eight-color swatch picker in the folder context menu tints the sidebar label and applies a colored background to folder items.",
      "Added auto-organize. The wand button near New Folder groups existing feeds into topic folders using a built-in keyword ruleset.",
      "Added feed sort mode. Feeds in the sidebar can now be sorted by name, unread count, or kept in the original custom order.",

      "The article list is now virtualized. Scrolling through All Items with hundreds of articles no longer causes layout jank.",
      "The desktop breakpoint was lowered from 1024px to 768px so tablet-sized windows use the multi-panel layout.",
